## About HistoriCAL

HistoriCAL is a web app that provides information and context surrounding historical landmarks in the greater Berkeley area. Using Google Maps the app generates a walking route to the various landmarks in Berkeley. For each landmark, we provide the official name, the date the landmark was established, and both old and modern pictures. In addition to creating a tour based on a landmark you choose, we also provide a currated, preset trails based around Northside and West Berkeley.

## Why we made it?
HistoriCAL's mission is to give users a greater understanding of the rich history of Berkeley in a way that educates users, while also giving a "workout". The history of old Berkeley is often ignored, but with this app we plan on bringing this old knowledge to the modern world through our app.
